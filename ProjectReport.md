## Introduction
IntelliOverflow is an extension for Integrated Development Environments that will be able to recommend Stack Overflow posts to a developer based on various warnings/errors they may encounter while writing their code.

## Motivation
Domain experts (mathematicians, scientists, researchers) may occasionally need to run some code for their work. For example, they may need to analyze some data or run certain algorithms for their research. These experts often do not have the specialized expertise and theory of a Software Engineer. Their solutions are to either hire someone to write the code for them, which costs money, or they can attempt to write the code themselves but may be unsuccesful. The aim for this project is to help this target group in writing their own code and solving issues or errors that may arise in their attempt.

Another target group for this project is experienced software developers that can use the plugin as a companion while coding for quick and easy in-app solutions to problems they run into.

## Implementation

## Milestone 1
Milestone 1 has consisted of research and learning in two areas. The first being how to use the StackExchange API to search for Stack Overflow posts and the other area being learning the Visual Studio SDK for Visual Studio extension development. Some of the resources I have used for this milestone are listed below

- Stack Exchange API Docs - https://api.stackexchange.com/docs
- VSSDK Docs - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/visual-studio-sdk?view=vs-2019
- Sample VS Extensions - https://github.com/microsoft/VSSDK-Extensibility-Samples
- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Docs - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/getting-started-with-wpf?view=vs-2019
